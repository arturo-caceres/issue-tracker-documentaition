# Trello

We decided to use Trello, as our project management tool to keep track of our group progress and assign tasks to each member of the group. <br>

Initially, we started at the planning phase, looking for the best idea to challenge us as junior developers. By using Trello, all cards must go through the following process to keep track of our features/tasks;

- Backlog
- To Do
- In progress
- On Hold
- Done

During this project, as a Team we will apply Scrum rituals, to succeed in delivering this application. With the use of Labels, Assign to Member options, Checklists, Dates and other Power-ups, we will be able excel on our project. <br>

## Management Methodology

### Scrumban

The Team has decided to use the [Scrumban](https://www.infolio.co/post/how-to-get-started-with-scrumban) Methodology.
Agile project management using scrumban is a relatively new hybrid methodology that combines scrum with Kanban. Kanban's flexibility is combined with the structure of scrum to create a unique approach to managing projects.

Scrumban works on the principle of planning-on-demand rather than working in timeboxed sprints, and tasks are assigned by the team as long as they can accommodate them, like in Kanban. As a result, work in progress is limited, and the development team can concentrate on tasks at hand instead of worrying about what the sprint review will reveal.

There's more to it than just Kanban. The Scrumban process maintains a daily Scrum with reviews and retrospectives only used when needed to optimize the process. As a result of the lack of sprints, planning is done as-needed, rather than around a sprint, potentially saving time.
